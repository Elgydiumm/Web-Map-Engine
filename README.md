# Web Map Engine
Web Map Engine (WME) is an project that aims to create a tool for fantasy map makers to conveniently store information about their maps by inserting points of interest such as cities, or just importing their nations in, and allowing them to write information about that point of interest. This can be used to share information about a fantasy world in an intuitive way. For example the system can be used by a Dungeon Master to display locational information in an intuitive way.

# Using Web Map Engine
WME is fully open-source and you are free to build and host it yourself. Currently it is hosted on [github pages aswell](https://elgydiumm.github.io/Web-Map-Engine/).
