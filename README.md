# Web Map Engine
Web Map Engine (WME) is an project that aims to create a tool for fantasy map makers to conveniently store information about their maps by inserting points of interest such as cities, or just importing their nations in, and allowing them to write information about that point of interest. This can be used to share information about a fantasy world in an intuitive way, or for table top game use in for example Dungeons and Dragons, where the Dungeon Master can use the accesibility of information from such a system.
